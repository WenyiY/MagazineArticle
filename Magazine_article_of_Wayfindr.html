			<h3>Wayfindr empowers vision impaired people to navigate the world independently</h3>
			<p id="paragraph1">There are an estimated 285 million vision impaired people worldwide. Sadly, 
			the consequences of sight loss are often poverty, isolation and depression. 
			Of the estimated two million people living with sight loss in the UK, almost
			 half say they would like to leave their home more often.
			<br><br>The Wayfindr Open Standard aims to do just that. So far they have released
			 the first Working Draft of the Open Standard, following successful trials in 
			 London and Sydney. They are now working to mature and develop the Open Standard further.</p>

			<center><h4>The "what if" moment</h4></center>
			<p id="paragraph2">What if vision impaired people were empowered to navigate 
			independently using the smart phone they already have in their pocket?
			 This was the challenge posed by Royal London Society for Blind People (RLSB)
			  Youth Forum to ustwo in 2014.
			<br><br>With limited or no vision, navigating an unfamiliar environment means
			 you are wholly reliant on auditory cues or a sighted guide for directions. 
			 Emerging technologies such as smartphones and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 
			 Beacons point to a future of independent navigation for blind people. There
			  is a pressing need to develop a consistent standard to be implemented across 
			  wayfinding systems. This will open up a world where vision impaired people are
			   no longer held back by their sight loss.
			   <br><br>Built into the Wayfindr standard is a determination to create social,
			    economic and personal value for users. During their trials they have seen an 
			    increase in the confidence of their participants. Every time a vision impaired 
			    person independently reaches their desired destination using Wayfindr it changes
			     their perceptions of their own abilities. They believe that as the adoption of 
			     the Wayfindr standard increases, this impact will propagate across the globe.</p>

			<center><h5>Their mission</h5></center>
			<p id="paragraph3">Emerging indoor navigation technologies hold the key to a revolution in
			 independent navigation for blind and partially sighted people. In order to 
			 achieve the greatest impact globally, they aim to develop a consistent standard 
			 across wayfinding systems.</p>

			<center><h5>What they do</h5></center>
			<p id="paragraph3">Wayfindr is building an Open Standard that will give you 
			the tools to create inclusive, and consistent, experiences for your customers. 
			They have released their first Working Draft, based on real world research, 
			and are now working on the updated version. Their significant expertise in 
			delivering successful trial installations in stations in London and Sydney 
			will help you understand how audio-based wayfinding can help your customers.</p>

		<div id="par4">
			<center><h6>Their work</h6></center>
			<p id="paragraph4">Wayfindr has been working with Transport for London for over a year,
			 exploring the potential for audio navigation in an underground environment. 
			 In February 2015 they trialled an installation of beacons in Pimlico Underground 
			 Station in London. This developed into a further trial at Euston station in late 2015.
			<br><br>They are not yet at the point that this is open to the public, but they are
			 continuing to work together in order to explore ways to make it available in 
			 the future.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p id="quote">"Ultimately this innovative project is about giving our vision 
			  impaired customers the flexibility to travel with the same independence and 
			  spontaneity as everyone else."</p>

			<center><h7>Why does this project matter?</h7></center>
			<p id="paragraph5">Wayfindr has a great impact on the social side. 
			There are an estimated 285 million people worldwide living with sight loss. 
			According to the research that of the estimated 2 million vision 
			impaired people in the UK, almost half say they would like to leave their home 
			more often. But leaving home by themselves is difficult. The invention of 
			the Wayfindr give the blind people a chance to walk outside by themselves. 
			They can have more free time and can do more stuff independently, which give
			them more confidence in their life. Also removing barriers to employment, to meeting 
			friends and family and engaging in their community.
			<br><br>Wayfindr has a great impact on the technological side as well.
			With this bluetooth technology, we can not only use it on the navigation system,
			but also on other things. For example, we can put it in the museum to give a brief 
			introduction to every exhibit people pass by. By using this, visitors can just 
			take out their smartphones and put in the earphone. That is lot easier than the guide
			inside the museum!
			   <br>Wayfindr laso has a big impact on the design side.
			   They are making a system that people can use simply by their smartphones.
			   They do not need to use the different kinds of devices anymore. This is lot
			   easier for everyone using it.</p>
